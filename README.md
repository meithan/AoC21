# AoC21

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). In Python 3.

I'll be updating this as a sort of mini blog whenever I can, commenting on the daily problems.

You can also check out our fancy [custom private leaderboard](https://meithan.net/AoC21/), with medals awarded to the fastest solvers. See (and download/fork!) the project [here](https://github.com/meithan/AoCBoard).

Go to day: [1](#day1) [2](#day2)

**Day 2**: [ Dive!](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2)<a name="day1"></a>

3m 35s (#1583) / 5m 13s (#985) - [code](https://github.com/meithan/AoC20/blob/main/day02/day02.py)

Another warm-up. I got both gold medals on our private leaderboard out of pure luck, honestly, as I beat the runner-up by only a few seconds!

**Day 1**: [Sonar Sweep](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)<a name="day1"></a>

3m 11s (#1552) / 6m 04s (#973) - [code](https://github.com/meithan/AoC20/blob/main/day01/day01.py)

As usual Day 1 is just a warm-up. Not very impressed with the time it took me to correctly write a few lines of code, but oh well. At least I got both gold medals on our [private leaderboard](https://meithan.net/AoC21/).
