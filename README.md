My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). In Python 3.

You can also check out our fancy [custom private leaderboard](https://meithan.net/AoC21/), with medals awarded to the fastest solvers. See (and download/fork!) the project [here](https://github.com/meithan/AoCBoard).
